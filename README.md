# nole-path-ai-career-platform
🏆 2nd Place — AWS hackathon

## Overview
Nole Path is an AI-powered career readiness platform designed to guide students from skill discovery to internship placement by integrating resume optimization, job matching, mentorship recommendations, and opportunity sourcing into a unified system. The prototype explored scalable, cloud-native architecture for delivering personalized guidance using agent-style workflows and AWS infrastructure.

This project was developed as part of the AWS Design Sprint competition and focused on demonstrating how generative AI and serverless services can be combined to support large-scale student career services.

*Note: This demo reflects the competition prototype and may not include full production functionality.*

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to identify relevant internships, understand employer skill expectations, and translate academic experience into competitive applications. At the same time, career centers face scalability challenges in providing personalized advising.

Nole Path addresses this by:
- Building dynamic student skill profiles
- Matching students to opportunities using compatibility scoring
- Providing AI-driven resume and preparation feedback
- Aggregating internship listings from multiple sources

---

## System Capabilities
- AI career coaching and skill gap identification  
- Resume alignment and optimization guidance  
- Internship compatibility scoring  
- Opportunity aggregation via scraping workflows  
- Mentorship and preparation recommendations  
- Scalable architecture supporting large user bases

## Architecture & Technology Stack
The prototype leveraged AWS services to simulate a modular agent-driven pipeline:

- **Amazon Bedrock** — LLM-driven coaching and interaction  
- **AWS Lambda** — Serverless compute for workflow execution  
- **API Gateway** — Endpoint routing and orchestration  
- **Amazon S3** — Storage for resumes, job data, and profiles  
- **Amazon Cognito** — Authentication and user identity  
- **AWS IAM** — Access control and permissions  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** — Monitoring and logging  

This stack enabled a scalable, event-driven architecture capable of handling dynamic user interactions.

## Estimated Cost Model
Prototype analysis projected infrastructure costs of approximately:

**~$60/day for 1,000 users**

Demonstrating feasibility of scalable deployment in an academic environment.
